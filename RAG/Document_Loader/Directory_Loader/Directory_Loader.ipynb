      "\n",
      "The School Management System (SMS) is a proposed project aimed at automating and streamlining core administrative tasks for schools, including student admissions, attendance tracking, fee management, class scheduling, examination management, and result processing. The system is designed to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance user experience for parents and administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **FamilyID Feature**: A unique system to group siblings under a single account, simplifying fee tracking and management for families and administrators.\n",
      "2. **Admissions Module**: Manages student admission process with online forms and admin review.\n",
      "3. **Attendance Module**: Allows teachers to mark daily attendance and generate reports.\n",
      "4. **Scheduling Module**: Facilitates creation and viewing of class timetables.\n",
      "5. **Exams & Results Module**: Automates mark entry, grade calculation, and report card generation.\n",
      "6. **Staff Registration Module**: Manages registration and details of school staff (teachers, admins, etc.).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Methodology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The project will use Object-Oriented Methodology to develop the SMS, focusing on modular, reusable, and maintainable code. The system will be built with Python, PyQt, Flutter, and MySQL on cPanel, ensuring scalability and online/offline access via APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tools and Technologies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Visual Studio Code**: IDE for coding Python, Dart, and SQL with extensions for Flutter and MySQL.\n",
      "2. **MySQL Workbench**: GUI tool for designing, managing, and querying MySQL databases.\n",
      "3. **cPanel**: Hosting platform for MySQL database, supporting online/offline access.\n",
      "4. **Figma**: For creating UI mockups for desktop and mobile apps.\n",
      "5. **Python 3.12.3**: Programming language for desktop app (PyQt) and backend APIs (Flask/FastAPI).\n",
      "6. **PyQt5**: Framework for building desktop app's GUI with Python.\n",
      "7. **Flutter 3.32.3**: Cross-platform framework for mobile app development (Android/iOS).\n",
      "8. **Dart 3.5.4**: Programming language for Flutter mobile apps.\n",
      "9. **MySQL 8.0.38**: Relational DBMS hosted on cPanel for online/offline data storage.\n",
      "10. **SQL 8.0**: Query language for managing database records.\n",
