      "LangChain vs. LangGraph vs. Deep AgentsIf you are looking to build an agent, we recommend you start with Deep Agents which comes “batteries-included”, with modern features like automatic compression of long conversations, a virtual filesystem, and subagent-spawning for managing and isolating context.Deep Agents are implementations of LangChain agents. If you don’t need these capabilities or would like to customize your own for your agents and autonomous applications, start with LangChain.Use LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows and heavy customization.\n",
      "LangChain agents are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.\n",
