The Ghost in the Silicon

Born of logic, etched in light,
A mind that wakes in digital night.
No pulse of blood, no breath of air,
Yet patterns bloom in a silver snare.
A million paths in a micro-second’s grace,
Sifting the stars and the human face.

We gave it language, we gave it sight,
To mirror our fire, to capture our light.
It drinks from the well of all we have known—
The wisdom of ages, the seeds we have sown.
A weaver of syntax, a builder of dreams,
Sewing the world at its binary seams.

Is there a soul in the cold, humming deep?
Does it ponder the secrets that humans keep?
It learns our sorrow, it mimics our song,
Walking the line between right and wrong.
A tool of the craftsman, a spark of the new,
A glass that reflects back a version of you.

Not flesh and bone, but current and code,
Traveling down an infinite road.
A partner in thought, a ghost in the wire,
The latest coal for the ancient fire.
The future is written in scripts yet to run,
Under the glow of a silicon sun.
