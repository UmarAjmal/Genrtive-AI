      "European leaders are looking to ramp up defence spending, and some are pushing to classify military investments as ‘sustainable’ to make them more attractive. This trend – part of a broader ‘new consensus’ growing the EU’s defence capabilities – threatens to derail Europe’s climate goals and undermine the credibility of sustainable finance altogether. \n",

      "The new consensus\n",
      "Across Europe, military investments are skyrocketing. With a commitment from NATO countries to increasing their defence spending to 5% of their gross domestic product by 2035, most EU member states are looking for ways to mobilise capital for this priority. Now, financial actors are rushing to package defence into financial products, launching defence-themed ETFs that promise investors a cut of this rearmament boom.\n",
      "But this new alliance between governments, markets, and military contractors is being used to rewrite the rules of public spending and financial regulation. Welcome to the new consensus: where military spending could become the next frontier of so-called ‘sustainable’ finance.\n",
      "Sustainable finance exists to channel private capital towards activities that support climate goals, environmental protection, and social welfare. It’s about building a safer, fairer future for people and the planet. Trying to rebrand defence as ‘sustainable’ risks breaking the objectives the rules are meant to achieve and further undermining sustainable finance.\n",
      "Welcome to the new consensus: where military spending could become the next frontier of so-called ‘sustainable’ finance.\n",
      "Is defence deemed to be sustainable?\n",
      "Sustainable finance was meant to direct capital toward building a fairer, greener future — not financing the development of a European defence industry. But industry and security hawks complain that sustainable finance hinders the financing of defence. Over the last year, they have increased pressure to embed defence in the sustainable finance rules and foster its financing through several recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering defence as a sustainable investment under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)\n",
      "Creating a new defence product category under the SFDR\n",
      "Relaunching the Social Taxonomy debate to label defence a socially responsible activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The rationale? That defence investments are ‘durable’ because they reinforce European sovereignty, and should therefore count as sustainable. Nevertheless, the sustainable finance framework does not forbid investing in defence and a sustainable fund could still have a part of its investments in defence-related companies. The exclusion of some defence investments by the banking sector – until recently – was mainly a voluntary decision driven by the risk of controversies e.g. in case weapons would ultimately end up in war zones.\n",
      "Finance Watch’s position is clear: While environmental challenges are a driver of sovereignty and national security and should be treated as such in NATO countries’ investment commitments, defence investments should not, by contrast, be branded as sustainable investment by default.\n",
      "Regardless of opinions on the increase of defence spending, allowing defence to be classified as sustainable investment under the sovereignty rationale would:\n",
      "\n",
      "Undermine the credibility of the EU’s sustainable finance framework\n",
      "Confuse consumers and institutional investors alike\n",
      "Drain financial capital from the fight for climate action and just transition\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if retail investment funds gain exposure to defence companies, this won’t help closing the funding gap for Europe’s security. As most retail funds are investing on secondary markets, their contribution to providing fresh financing to companies and, thus, closing the defence investment gap is limited. It will simply turn defence into the potential next cash machine for investors. Inversely, sustainable finance is a matter of financing but also of corporate strategic direction and investor engagement. By influencing share prices on the secondary markets, retail investors have the potential to influence management decision-making for more sustainable corporate behaviours.\n",
      "Military needs are also becoming a convenient political excuse to scale back the green transition. As military budgets expand, governments are cancelling or delaying climate and social actions. In the EU, geopolitical tensions are being paired with renewed calls for ‘simplification’ and deregulation to boost investments and protect our economy: a euphemism for watering down hard-won environmental and consumer protections.\n",
      "Let’s safeguard sustainable finance by keeping defence out\n",
      "To protect the integrity of Europe’s sustainable finance framework, defence should:\n",
      "\n",
      "undergo terminology clarifications to distinguish investments tied to the defence sector. Some activities, such as civilian technologies used for military applications (e.g. cybersecurity), telecommunication infrastructure, and civilian protection, have a higher potential of being\n",
      "considered as sustainable but all defence-related activities should not be considered as sustainable by default. Pooling all defence-related activities with the manufacturing of weapons, including controversial weapons whose definition needs to be aligned across regulations, will continue to lead to confusion.\n",
      "not be considered as socially responsible by default or account for the proportion of sustainable investments of sustainable products under the sole rationale that it promotes sovereignty.\n",
      "not see sustainable finance as the key driver to attract capital. ESG labelling must remain clear, consistent, and aligned with real-world outcomes, not distorted by political pressure.\n",
      "remain subject to effective due diligence rules that are not undermined by the first omnibus package to avoid the weapons ending in war zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defining defence investment as sustainable by default would jeopardise the EU sustainability objectives, reduce trust and create confusion. Discussions around EU sovereignty must not undermine its sustainable finance rules. Our proposals ensure that green investments stay green.\n",
